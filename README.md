<strong>Morric's Magical Cauldron</strong> is a collection of random content generators intended to be used in casual games of <em>Dungeons of Dragons</em>.
As well as generating random content from pre-defined tables (for example, Character Names by Race), it also randomises user submitted content, including Plot Hooks, Distinguishing Features, and other personality traits.

User submitted content and accounts are handled by a WordPress and GraphQL powered backend.
